# Project description:

I Started this project as a proof of concept, applying some of what I have learned in the last two years, and by NO means this project is production oriented. This project aims to test the ability to create a new project structure in the form of a client server networked application as opposed to the single process programs made in the past.


# Project structure:

**This repository should hold the two components of the program.**

1- The first being the SimpleChat-Server **(Java Application)** which is a headless process meant to run in the background listening to the HTTP requests generated by the client application instances.

2- The second part is the mobile application **(Kotlin Application)** that provides a graphical interface to the user to be able to send and receive HTTP requests related to the first components. 

3- more client apps in the future... 

# Tools used:
  * IntelliJ ==> Java IDE used to develop the chat server
  * MySQL    ==> The Database system Managed by MySQL Workbench
