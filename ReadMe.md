# Project description:

I Started this project as a proof of concept applying some of  what I have learned in the last two years. This project aims to test the ability to create a new project structure in the form of a client server networked application as opposed to the single process programs made in the past.


# Project structure:

**This repository should hold the two coponents of the program.**

1- The first being the SimpleChat-Server **(Java Application)** which is a headless process meant to run in the background listening to the HTTP requests generated by the client application instances.

2- The second part is the moblle application **(Kotlin Application)** that provides a graphical interface to the user to be able to send and recieve HTTP requests related to the first components. 

3- more client apps in the future...
